Collection of Tools
===================
    This is a collection of tools and FAQs to document my journey in
    OpenStack and Kubernetes.

    ko.py - is a kolla-kubernetes deployer. It works to a degree but
    this project has been sunsetted and openstack-helm is the new
    method of deploying openstack on Kubernetes.

    k8s.py - is a python-based tool to bring up Kubernetes on a single
    VM or bare-metal host. It is supposed to be simple and quick and
    provide a way to grow out your cluster by adding minions.

    All comments, suggestions and improvements welcome.
